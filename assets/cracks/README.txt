Instructions:
1) Add an exclusion to your folder for the Siege version you downloaded (important!! otherwise it will delete the crack files and the game won't launch)
2) Copy all the files from the correct folder (note that Release/Vanilla Siege is included in the Y1SX-Y6S2 crack)
3) Paste them INSIDE the Siege version you downloaded
4) Click "Yes to All" when asked to overwrite files (if you don't get any notice of any file being overwritten, you pasted the files in the wrong place)
5) Depending on your version, open CPlay.ini/CODEX.ini/uplay_r2.ini with Notepad and change GAMENAME (very important!!) and USERNAME
6) Run the game by double-clicking RainbowSix.bat
